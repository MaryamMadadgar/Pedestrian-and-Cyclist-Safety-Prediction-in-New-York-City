# Pedestrian-and-Cyclist-Safety-Prediction-in-New-York-City-App
safe-location-in-nyc.onrender.com

This project leverages Python and the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to evaluate pedestrian and cyclist safety in New York City. Utilizing a decade of data (2013-2022) from the Motor Vehicle Collisions â€“ Crashes dataset sourced from data.gov, it classifies safety risk into three categories: "Low or Medium Risk," "High Risk" and "Very High Risk." In this context, "Low or Medium Risk" designates locations that are relatively safe for pedestrians and cyclists. "High Risk" and "Very High Risk"  indicate progressively greater danger, with "Very High Risk" implying potential fatalities or injuries for pedestrians or cyclists.

Application Inputs:

The associated application allows users to input the following parameters to assess safety risk for a specific location and time:

Month: Choose the month from 1 to 12 for which you want to evaluate safety risk.
Hour: Specify the hour from 0 to 23 of the day for the assessment.
Hourly Precipitation: Users can refer to instructions provided within the application to determine how to input and interpret hourly precipitation data.
Longitude and Latitude: Input the coordinates of the location you want to assess (You can find them from Google map).
Output: Risk Category

The application provides a "risk category" as the output, which corresponds to the safety level for pedestrians and cyclists in the specified location and time. Users can make informed decisions based on these risk categories, contributing to safer urban environments.
